## Technical Assignment

The task at hand entails crafting a simulation model for the operating system, and carrying out the following tasks:
  - Generate processes that exhibit specific traits, as defined at the commencement of the model;
  - Build a process scheduler that utilizes the HPF algorithm and an array of queues, leveraging simplified hashing techniques;
  - Construct device schedulers, and implement device queues for seamless integration;
  - Design and deploy a memory scheduler, along with a comprehensive memory management system;
  - Integrate an intuitive graphical user interface, complete with customizable system settings and real-time statistical tracking capabilities.
